"""LatencyProbe implementations for the HueSync output delay subsystem.

NoLatencyProbe    — always returns 0; for local squeezelite players.
FixedLatencyProbe — returns a configured constant; for AirPlay and any other
                    player where the delay is negotiated and stable.

UpnpPositionProbe (step 3) will be added here to handle the Sonos case where
the offset is not negotiated and may drift with WiFi conditions.
