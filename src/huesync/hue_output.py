"""Hue Entertainment output driver.

This is the only module in HueSync that imports from hue_entertainment.
Everything Hue-specific lives here: LightColorCommand construction, the
EntertainmentSession lifecycle, and channel position fetching.

The OutputDriver pattern means effects never know about channel IDs or
transport details — they produce a Scene (colour as a function of position)
and HueDriver samples it at each registered light's location.

Single-stream constraint: the Hue bridge only supports one Entertainment
stream at a time per bridge.  PlayerManager enforces this at the session
level by calling deactivate() before each activate().  HueDriver itself
has no cross-instance guard; callers are responsible for the ordering.
